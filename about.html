								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<ul>
								  <li>I received my MSc in Computer Science at Northwestern University. My research supervisor was
										Dr. Aggelos K. Katsaggelos. My research was focused on deep learning and computer vision as applied to medical images.</li>
								  <li>I received my BSc from the Computer Science program at McGill University. My undergraduate research advisor was
										Prof. Joseph Vybihal. My research focused on image recognition utilizing neural networks.</li>
								  <li>My research interests include: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.</li>
								  <li>My favorite hobby is game development! I especially love making small projects to recreate specific game mechanics/design
									to get a better understanding of how they work, and appreciation for everything that goes into making them work smoothly.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Recent News</h2>
								<ul>
								  <li>December 16, 2022. Graduated from Northwestern University, with a Master's of Science, in Computer Science.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>My Story</h2>
								<p>
									I originally began university with the goal of eventually going to medical school, as I had always grown up wanting
									to do something I felt could greatly help people. I had begun coding in high school as an attempt to pick up game
									development as a hobby, and quickly grew a passion for coding in my spare time. I eventually got to begin practicing
									with game development by the time I began university, and chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major. During my
									time in university I had found myself interested in other fields I had never heard of or understood before I began
									coding like “big data”, “machine learning”, “computer vision” etc. After getting the opportunity to to learn about
									a myriad of subjects relating to Computer Science, my passion for technology grew, and after discovering all of the
									different ways technology could be utilized to help people, my passion for it eventually outpaced my passion for medicine.
								</p>

								<p>
									I’ve just now graduated from my master's degree in computer science, and during my degree I’m lucky to have had the opportunity 
									to deepen my understanding in the topics I'm most passionate about like deep learning, computer vision with extensive research. 
									I am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I've gained in a professional setting and contribute to the success of a high-profile 
									organization.
