									I originally began university with the goal of eventually going to medical school, as I had always grown up wanting
									to do something I felt could greatly help people. I had begun coding in high school as an attempt to pick up game
									development as a hobby, and quickly grew a passion for coding in my spare time. I eventually got to begin practicing
									with game development by the time I began university, and chose Computer Science as my undergraduate major. During my
									time in university I had found myself interested in other fields I had never heard of or understood before I began
									coding like “big data”, “machine learning”, “computer vision” etc. After getting the opportunity to to learn about
									a myriad of subjects relating to Computer Science, my passion for technology grew, and after discovering all of the
									different ways technology could be utilized to help people, my passion for it eventually outpaced my passion for medicine.
								</p>
								  I’ve graduated this year with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Life Sciences, and during my degree I’m lucky to
									have had the opportunity to learn about and code in a variety of computer science subjects, from computer vision to
									assembly language. While I’m quite interested in the majority of the ones I’ve learned about, especially game development
									and big data, I’d say that my greatest affection lies with machine learning. I hope to continue pursuing new opportunities
									of learning and honing my skills in this field and others in an effort to get to the point where I can make contributions
									that can help others.
